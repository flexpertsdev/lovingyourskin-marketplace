# Mock Data Usage Report

## Executive Summary

**Status: ✅ No mock data is used in the production application**

The `/mock-data` directory contains product and brand data that was used for initial Firebase migration but is **NOT referenced by any application source code** in the `src/` directory. The application exclusively uses Firebase services for all data operations.

## Analysis Results

### 1. Application Source Code (src/)
- **Pages**: ✅ No references to mock-data
- **Components**: ✅ No references to mock-data  
- **Services**: ✅ No references to mock-data
- **Stores**: ✅ No references to mock-data
- **Hooks**: ✅ No references to mock-data
- **Types**: ✅ No references to mock-data

### 2. Files That Reference Mock Data

All references to mock-data are found only in migration/import scripts:

#### Migration Scripts

   - Purpose: Add B2C fields to existing product data

5. **scripts/migrate-product-images.js**
   - References: `../mock-data/firestore/products-1754297314.json`
   - Purpose: Migrate product images to Firebase Storage

6. **scripts/migrate-product-images-admin.js**
   - References: `../mock-data/firestore/products-1754297314.json`
   - Purpose: Admin version of image migration

7. **scripts/migrate-images-with-auth.js**
   - References: `../mock-data/firestore/products-1754297314.json`
   - Purpose: Authenticated image migration

8. **scripts/image-migration-summary.js**
   - References: `../mock-data/firestore/products-1754297314.json`
   - Purpose: Generate summary of image migration

9. **scripts/image-migration/compare-products.js**
   - References: 
     - `../../mock-data/products_backup.json`
     - `../../mock-data/products.json`
     - `../../mock-data/brands.json`
   - Purpose: Compare product data before/after migration

```

### File Purposes

#### Core Data Files
- **brands.json**: Master brand data file (currently modified in git)
- **products.json**: Master product data file
- **products_backup.json**: Backup before migrations

#### Brand-Specific Files
- **[brand]-products.json**: Individual brand product data
- **[brand]-brand.json**: Individual brand metadata

#### Firestore Migration Files
- **firestore/*.json**: Firebase-ready formatted data
- Timestamped files for tracking migration versions

#### Source HTML Files
- **B2B Website infos-2/**: Original HTML exports from the old system
- Used as source for data extraction

## Migration Status

### Completed Migrations ✅
Based on the presence of migration scripts and Firebase configuration:
1. Brand data migrated to Firestore
2. Product data migrated to Firestore  
3. Product images migrated to Firebase Storage
4. B2C fields added to products

### Current Data Flow
```
Application (src/) 
    ↓
Firebase Services (src/services/firebase/)
    ↓
Firebase Backend (Auth, Firestore, Storage)
```

**Note**: Mock data is NOT part of the active data flow

## Git Status

### Modified Files
- `mock-data/brands.json` - Modified but not used by application

### Untracked Files
Various documentation and task files in `docs/` directory

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions
- ✅ **No critical issues** - Mock data is properly isolated from production code
- Consider committing the modified `brands.json` if changes are intentional

### 2. Cleanup Opportunities (Optional)
Since all migrations appear complete and the application uses Firebase:

1. **Archive mock-data directory**
   - Move to a `data-archive/` directory
   - Or add to `.gitignore` if no longer needed

2. **Keep only essential migration scripts**
   - Archive completed one-time migration scripts
   - Keep reusable import scripts for future use

3. **Document migration history**
   - Create a MIGRATION_HISTORY.md file
   - Record what was migrated and when

### 3. Best Practices Going Forward
1. **Never import mock data in application code**
   - Continue using Firebase services exclusively
   - Keep mock data isolated to scripts/

2. **Use environment-based configuration**
   - Development: Can use Firebase emulators
   - Production: Uses live Firebase

3. **Version control considerations**
   - Consider removing large JSON files from git
   - Use Firebase backups for data versioning

## Verification Commands

To verify no mock-data usage in source:
```bash
# Check for any imports
grep -r "mock-data" src/

# Check for specific file references
grep -r "products\.json\|brands\.json" src/

# Find any JSON imports
find src -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" | xargs grep "\.json"
```

All commands should return no results.

## Conclusion

The application is correctly architected with complete separation between:
- **Mock/migration data** (in `/mock-data`, used only by scripts)
- **Production application** (in `/src`, uses only Firebase)

This separation ensures:
- ✅ No hardcoded data in production
- ✅ Clean deployment packages
- ✅ Proper data management through Firebase
- ✅ No security risks from exposed mock data

**Status: Production-ready with regard to data management**
