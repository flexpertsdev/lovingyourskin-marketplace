## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Decisions

### File Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/           # Base components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ layout/       # Page layouts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/     # Feature-specific
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/       # Shared business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/           # Route components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/           # Custom hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/             # Utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ store/           # Zustand stores
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/          # Global styles
```

### Component Patterns
- Compound components for complex UI
- Container/Presenter pattern for data fetching
- Custom hooks for business logic
- Lazy loading for route splitting

### State Management
- Zustand for client state (auth, cart, ui)
- React Query for server state
- Context for theme/language
- Local storage for persistence

### Firebase Structure
```
/users/{userId}
/companies/{companyId}
/products/{productId}
/orders/{orderId}
/messages/{threadId}
/invites/{inviteCode}
```

## üö® Critical Path Items
1. Invite system must work perfectly (no public registration)
2. MOQ validation is business-critical
3. Per-brand checkout separation
4. Message threads must never mix orders
5. Multi-language must work from day 1

## üìù Notes
- Start with mobile-first approach
- Use skeleton screens for loading states
- Implement error boundaries early
- Add analytics events throughout
- Keep Firebase rules strict

This plan is designed to be self-executing. Each checkbox can be checked off as completed, providing clear progress tracking.
