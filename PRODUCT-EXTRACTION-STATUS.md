# Product Data Extraction Summary

## Completed
1. ✅ Created data extraction structure for products
2. ✅ Extracted brand information from BRANDS.html
   - Wismin: Shipping NOT free (+$1.30 per item)
   - The Cell Lab: Free shipping + display stands support
   - Other brands: Free shipping
3. ✅ Manually extracted 6 products from The Cell Lab as examples
4. ✅ Created TypeScript interfaces for proper data structure

## Data Structure Created
```typescript
Product {
  id: string
  brandId: string
  brandName: string
  name: string
  volume: { amount, unit, display }
  description: string
  prices: {
    retail: { currency, amount }
    wholesale: { currency, amount, moq, moqUnit }
  }
  inventory: {
    stock: number
    unitsPerCarton: number
    expiryDate: string
    pao: string
  }
  regulatory: {
    origin: string
    certifications: string[]
    ingredients: string[]
  }
  status: 'active' | 'discontinued' | 'presale'
  categories: string[]
  tags: string[]
}
```

## Still Needed

### 1. Extract Remaining Products
- [ ] Lalucell products
- [ ] Sunnicorn products  
- [ ] Baohlab products
- [ ] Wismin products
- [ ] The Cell Lab remaining products (9 more + sample sizes)

### 2. B2C Product Data
From the screenshots you showed:
- [ ] Shop/Boutique products with retail inventory
- [ ] Pre-sale products with different pricing
- [ ] Retail-friendly descriptions

### 3. Firebase Integration
- [ ] Update product schema in Firebase
- [ ] Create migration script
- [ ] Add new fields:
  - `isRetail`: boolean
  - `isPreSale`: boolean
  - `retailPrice`: number
  - `retailDescription`: string
  - `retailInventory`: number

### 4. UI Updates for Current React Site
- [ ] Add shipping info display per brand
- [ ] Update checkout to show shipping costs for Wismin
- [ ] Add "Display stands available" note for The Cell Lab

## Quick Actions You Can Take Now

1. **Use the existing mock data temporarily**:
   ```typescript
   import { THE_CELL_LAB_PRODUCTS, BRAND_INFO } from './src/data/extracted-products';
   ```

2. **Update Firebase product schema** to include new fields

3. **For Wismin shipping calculation**:
   ```typescript
   const calculateWisminShipping = (items: number) => {
     return items * 1.30;
   };
   ```

4. **Brand-specific checkout logic**:
   ```typescript
   const getShippingInfo = (brandId: string) => {
     const brand = BRAND_INFO[brandId];
     return {
       isFree: brand.isShippingFree,
       note: brand.shippingNote || 'Free shipping included (3-5 weeks by boat)'
     };
   };
   ```

## Recommendation
Given time constraints, I suggest:
1. Use the partial data I've extracted for The Cell Lab
2. Continue with current React app (postpone Nuxt migration)
3. Focus on getting the database schema right
4. Manually add remaining products later or use a CSV import tool

Would you like me to:
1. Create a Firebase migration script with the new schema?
2. Extract more products from the HTML files?
3. Create the UI components for shipping display?
